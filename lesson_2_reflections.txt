What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

-It creates a .git file to track metadata on the repository.  It is required 
to keep track of commits and essentially keep the data required to make Git a 
version control tool.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

-It is different from the working directory in that it separates files to be 
committed from the working directory.  The value is that you can see the files 
to be committed together and get a look to ensure that they satisfy a single 
logical change prior to being committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

-You can files in the staging area until you have completed the updates to 
all files pertaining to the logical change, then commit all modified files.
