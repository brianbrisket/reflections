When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

-When you are using other machines: whether it be collaboration or using 
another of your own in a different location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-You want to manually control the updates to your remote since you may not 
always have your program ready for the public with each commit.
