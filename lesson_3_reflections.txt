When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

-When you are using other machines: whether it be collaboration or using 
another of your own in a different location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-You want to manually control the updates to your remote since you may not 
always have your program ready for the public with each commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you 
use one instead of another?

-Forks: only from github to github.  Use when you want to make changes to 
someone else's repository and keep for your own.
-Clones: full repository copies, can be made local to local or github to local. 
Can be used to make changes to a repository on a local machine.
-Branches: only on a single repository.  Used to make a change to a repository, 
and to isolate all changes in case you want to restore the original or it can 
be used when multiple collaborators are working on features to the same 
repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

-The benefit is to make updates without having to be connected to the internet 
and to see if any updates have been pushed to the remote that you may not be 
aware of.
